*Note I used Ryan Fitzgerald's portfolio template as starter code for this assignment: https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devportfolio.

This app was designed to show a section about me, my education, work experience, allow users to download a pdf of my resume, and display skills/languages as well projects I have built so far.
